faverage : boolean
Average connectivity scores for each frequency band. If True, the output freqs will be a list with arrays of the frequencies that were averaged.

coh: (n_con, n_frequencies, n_times)
(n_con, n_frequencies, n_times) mode: ‘cwt_morlet’ when “indices” is specified and “n_con = len(indices[0])”.
